# Rock • Paper • Scissors (Vite + React + Tailwind)

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

## Notes
- Tailwind is pre-configured (see `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and `src/index.css`).
- The app includes lightweight self-tests that log to the browser console on startup.
- Keyboard shortcuts: **R / P / S** during the game.
